Magic tricks of this nature are nothing new and also honestly no matter which cord he pulled it was always to have the noose with Matt in it the magician is always in control the choice for an audience member or anyone else is the illusion. The reason I ask why this one specific is bc I remember seeing a female magician when I was younger on TV that did an illusion where an oversized drill head went through her stomach so was it just the nooses being involved? I am not defending them for doing this or saying Kai didn&#39;t know but will say Matt as the magician was in control of the outcome ultimately the ropes probably didn&#39;t control any of the doors and he had a remote tucked away that controlled all three I don&#39;t know for sure but one key to a magician&#39;s tricks is misdirection.",

The people I know taking these medications are just not hungry their diet is still 100% chips, pizza, soda, etc they just eat less of it and eventually their hunger cues return and they just have to up the dose.

Once these people get off these GLP-1s they\u2019re just going to continue to eat garbage and gain it all right back plus some then back on Ozempic.

Not everyone that supports DEI has thought about it critically enough IMO.  A lot of what I see when people talk about racism issues is people that want revenge not people that want to end racism.  And I don&#39;t think they do this consciously or maliciously.  It comes from a really emotional place for most people so I don&#39;t expect them to come at the issues analytically.  It just sucks because you can&#39;t have real conversation about it because people on both sides feel like they are being attacked for the color of their skin.",

Foreign companies don&#39;t sell that many of their now more expensive products. American companies are able to compete on pricing with foreign made products with human worker treatment and no sweat shops. Over time American companies and start ups making more money can innovate and lower their prices. Seems like pretty simple logic to follow to me. Also American good already have tariffs imposed in other countries. US is behind the ball there.

Can you imagine what the fuck America would do if China had troops all along theyir Mexican and Canadian border??? If you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about then just don&#39;t talk",

        "text": "Joe Rogan has always been a great entertainer but, similarly to Asmongold, can just have moments where his mind just completely leaves him, and when you&#39;re that popular surrounded by so many &quot;yes men&quot;, kind of turns what should have been a kick in the snow into a snowball effect. And it all really just has its roots in being very misinformed about a topic and/or a very poor choice of words and timing instead of politics. Not evil, just briefly and profoundly stupid. The issue therein lies with the people that surround them and glorify their statements, making them feel like preachers. It&#39;s hard to find out if you&#39;re wrong when all the noise makes you sound like you&#39;re right. Which makes them wonder if they should learn from it because clearly it sounds to them they made the right move. All it takes is someone they respect to get in their circle and have a discussion so the blinders aren&#39;t on by default, such as the Ukranian boxer.<br><br>Also, I have no idea how I managed it but for the first time in what feels like years, I honestly didn&#39;t even notice all those movies came out. I love watching shows and movies. Binged and finished Arcane season 2, and watched Alien Romulus, Borderlands, and Deadpool 3 in theatres. Yet, somehow I didn&#39;t even notice the existence of Moana 2, Gladiator 2, Inside Out 2, and Wicked. I never noticed the marketing campaign. I did see the trailer after intentionally looking up trailers out of curiosity some time back, but definitely never saw Wicked&#39;s or Moana 2. Maybe it&#39;s because of Youtube Premium but it definitely feels nice to feel outside the loop, for advertisements to not be screaming down my neck all the time that I have some surprise in my life.",

        "text": "&quot;flus can mix to become a new strain&quot; (paraphrased) - for anyone who doesn&#39;t know, the flu viruses are so good at evading the immune system because they: <br><br>1) have very slippery genomes. They&#39;re purposely not very good at preventing errors occurring in their DNA. They purposely have really high error rates (especially in certain areas of the genome) in order to maximise their genetic diversity, therefore escaping detection by the immune system etc.<br><br>2) they engage in horizontal gene transfer (this is what she is mostly on about). The viruses have segmented genes, and can transfer genes between each other. This means if the virus is getting wrecked by the immune system, and one individual gets a mutation to evade it, then it can transfer that gene to other viruses. This means if one evades the immune system, it doesn&#39;t have to survive to become the individual every new one comes from (really hard to do as it&#39;s more likely they&#39;ll get annihilated before reaching enough numbers, e.g. due to coming into random contact with a molecule that damages it). This also makes it so the immune system has less time to figure out this new adaption.<br><br>3) Flu viruses can perform recombination. This is essentially a last ditch attempt by the virus when it knows it&#39;s in trouble. It just randomly scrambles parts of the genome at the gene level. 99% of the time this is fatal and the virus no longer functions. But sometimes it works and the new ordering has immunity to what the immune system learnt. It&#39;s really crazy, and really a &quot;call in the airstrike on my position&quot; type deal. <br><br>The flu virus family&#39;s evolutionary plan is essentially &quot;I don&#39;t need no fancy deep exploit (e.g. like HIV) if I just keep changing myself so quickly that immune systems don&#39;t realise I&#39;m actually the same virus! Well it kind of brings up the &quot;is it really the same virus?&quot;. You could alternatively think of it like something that evolves fast it turns into a new species every several months.",

India has terrible inequailty with much of the pollution coming coal burning for electricity and from factories and manufacturing as well as vehicles in cities. But there is also the many many poor farmers who burn their crop stubble making parts of the year toxic with the smoke in addition to the regular pollution. Capitalism is to blame for this course we are on. We want cheap goods and the first world is content to let it&#39;s manufacturing base die from insane pollution as long as we get our cheap goods from temu. India, China and Vietnam are all getting very polluted making cheap crap for the United states and Europe.",

Women feel as though they need to keep the boot on other womens necks to keep competition low since we have to compete with the men who are up for the same promotions already. That doesnt even get into the issues with seniority in the job, age overall, etc. i had older woman fight me tooth and nail when i was a manager bc and i quote i started working before you popped out a p****y. Those women made that job harder because they felt i took their job (hel,  the woman who was forced to step down was still in the department,  so they sabotaged at any chance they could.",

At 54 years old she decided to show some people that she didn&#39;t learn bullying is not OK and sent out a transphobic hate-tweet.  This was done in the period this 22-year old transwoman had told about the death threats she had been receiving.<br>I still think that this former lawyer had no principles what so ever or decided that the ones she had should go out of the window the moment she saw a capability to join an extreme-right government or at least work towards radicalizing enough to do so (after receiving a knighthood by our King you can just see the tone on her Twitter profile shift towards more radicalized people, it is pretty astonishing to see).<br>Next to that, I can&#39;t help but feel that she felt the need to show toxic femininity: a transwoman managed to reach a position she might have wanted to have herself and thus, this transwoman needed to be thrown under the bus as quickly as possible.  This point to me is driven further home by the fact that she never gave a single F about this beauty pageant until a transwoman won it...<br><br>Oh, she calls herself a feminist, but next to her transphobia already making that impossible, also supports exclusionary, invasive sporting guidelines to &quot;protect women against transwomen&quot;.<br>When I asked her for examples about why this is necessary (since it is not a problem) she couldn&#39;t give them, and only said &quot;The moment free speech starts intersecting principles of other people and science it is important to hold a debate&quot;.<br>Which is the typical extreme-right politicians deflecting all blame, saying human rights are up for debate because some people are deserving of them more than others (Read: extreme-right politicians should have them, and anyone who doesn&#39;t fit their lovely view of society shouldn&#39;t...).  She also failed to mention the science there, she had no sources...<br>But especially the part about free speech is typical: her free speech, or that of other people?  Along with the obvious problem that all extreme-right politicians have with this concept: failing to mention that free speech doesn&#39;t exist without consequences.<br><br>It was not completely surprising to see her get convicted for group discrimination of muslim people.  While she as a former lower was continuously touting her knowledge of the law and mentioning how nuanced she is...<br>Ultraconservative, extreme-right politics is unfortunately contagious...",

The fact that he and his team blurred out the drivers speedometer just shows they knew that it was wrong for him to be driving that fast on a residential street and it&#39;s baffling that they thought it was wise to leave it in the video because even with the speedometers being blurred out people can still work/estimate how fast he was driving because we could hear how many gears he went through, can work out the distance the car travelled in x seconds...<br><br>It&#39;s not like he was driving just a little bit over the speed limit, he was driving A LOT over the speed limit and that is unquestionable unsafe, especially considering it&#39;s also in a school zone! it should be investigated by the local police department and MKBHD should receive a penalty of some sort. I don&#39;t believe a speeding fine is appropriate given that sort of money is nothing to someone like MKHBD. Likewise I don&#39;t believe driving bans for x months does much for most people.<br><br>Therefore I think the penalty should be a requirement for him to take part in a &quot;defensive driving&quot; initiative to learn to improve his driving abilities, understanding of road safety and would be the more humbling option; The police department could encourage him to admit his fuckup, show that he is fully understanding and turn the whole situation into learning experience for not just him but his viewers with them working with both the police &amp; the defensive driving course team to create an educational video with the earnings of that video going towards a road safety organisation.",

Boric acid is listed in a lot of medical guidelines as 2. line treatment option. Standard regimen is 7-21 days each night and then 2 times per week (Monday &amp; Thursday e.g.) for 3-12 months. I get my boric acid 600mg capsules shipped from the US. Please try it out. It really helped me a lot. My yeast is now gone. Hopefully I was able to help someone out. Good luck y&#39;all.",

Slovenia might be a small country, but it boasts several globally recognized individuals. For instance, Luka Don\u010di\u0107, an NBA All-Star for the Dallas Mavericks, cannot use an iPhone in his native language. Similarly, Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d, an Olympic gold medalist cyclist, and Goran Dragi\u0107, an NBA player, face the same issue. Even Melania Trump, the former First Lady of the United States and wife of Donald Trump, cannot use an iPhone or macOS in Slovenian.<br>While everyone is talking about AI, I believe Apple devices should first learn the Slovenian language; otherwise, AI would be extremely limited.",

I just open 3 apps at a time based on my working condition. I heard that macOS ARM processor is highly effective than the intel x86 processor. So it occupies the RAM effectively compared with windows lap RAM. So is 8gb enough ? And i also heard that m2 air ssd speed is really slower than the m1 air ssd because of lack of nano chips in m2 air than the m1 air. So does it really noticeable in daily life tasks ?",

The memory for different locations should be easy to realise with the help of your iPhone and Apple ID. Geo fencing is one part of the equation to recognise the different locations and iCloud storage is the other. Remembering where you placed your apps and their state when and where you left them requires very little memory.<br>As for integration of iPhone notifications into the Vision Pro; that&#39;s what Apple calls &quot;developer opportunity&quot;. If Apple does not implement it in the next visionOS update some developer will make lots of money with their App filling the gap until Apple does. I have to admit that I am not aware of a communication kit between visionOS and iOS, though.<br>And the keyboard thing should be easy for bluetooth Apple keyboards. Each of these keyboards has a model identifier. Link that with a 3D model of the keyboard and visionOS would be able to cut out the shape of the keyboard on the fly from the  rendered environment.",

I don&#39;t know why, but I guess it is because it has ended its agreement with Turkey. The last time it shared on the community section of the positive view channel, I wish you a blessed Eid al-Adha and the second comment on this message is about the request made by me, the owner of the channel called Space Man, to return. I would like you to please read that request. If you could please try to reach an agreement, I would be very happy. Because you left an army of 3 million 66 thousand people behind you and you are depriving this army by not sharing any more videos. I request that the necessary be done. With love.",

I don&#39;t know why, but I guess it is because it has ended its agreement with Turkey. The last time it shared on the community section of the positive view channel, I wish you a blessed Eid al-Adha and the second comment on this message is about the request made by me, the owner of the channel called Space Man, to return. I would like you to please read that request. If you could please try to reach an agreement, I would be very happy. Because you left an army of 3 million 66 thousand people behind you and you are depriving this army by not sharing any more videos. I request that the necessary be done. With love.",

Mt Rushmore was gifted to the US government after it was completed, which is why they control it and why they wont let us do a firework show during Fourth of July. Technically the Indian tribes did most of the hunting on the Buffalo and why they were at war with each other because certain tribes were taking too much. Also Bison gestation period is 9.5 months, it is very interesting and I would recommend learning more about this stuff. I am not an expert, I am just trying to do my best recall what i was taught in school.",

You can tell what news channel he watches and what his algorithm is showing him on a daily basis. He\u2019s too far gone and in the woods that he can\u2019t see things clearly. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642<br><br>\ud83e\uddd0Someone in the comments said \u201cUsing Joe Rogan\u2018s logic, if someone were to break into Rogan\u2018s house, then no one should help him\u201d. I would love for Rogan to think about that scenario along with what the intruders would take and do to his family if they knew they could get away with it with no consequences. I would love for him to sit and think how that would feel for his innocent wife and children if every thug knew they could intrude on his property and no one would do anything. And forget about being a tough guy, thinking you can defend yourself with your guns\u2026you only have so many bullets and eventually they\u2019d get in and make you pay \u201cDearly\u201d for not just letting them have your stuff and your family.

        "text": "When our binary star, a brown dwarf star companion to our current yellow dwarf star known as the Sun, comes passing through the inner solar system on its own solar path, it enforces a massive gravitational pressure upon everything it passes as it makes its way around the sun and back out to its furthest reaches. The ancients say this occurs every 3600 years. If you are on the far side of the sun as the brown dwarf passes into the solar system and around the sun, you are given a reprieve from most of the destructive powers, still being affected but not in the same way you would if you were in the path of it&#39;s journey. The shear gravitational force of its crossing can strip a planet of its atmosphere, cause cataclysmic siesmic and volcanic events, and, in turn, global flooding, pole shifts, mass extinctions etc. If you look far enough back in our broken concept of history, there are stories of the arrival of Marduk and the 200 Igigi, who left Mars because the binary stars crossing was coming so close to Mars it would evaporate the atmosphere on the planet, and it did. You look back even further to the Sumerian stories of creation, and it was the brown dwarf stars crossing that destroyed our original planet that was positioned between Mars and Jupiter, ultimately resulting in the asteroid belt currently floating between Mars and Jupiter and the planet on which we reside today, a fraction of its former self, placed in it&#39;s current position due to the loss of its mass and gravitational force after the collision with the dwarf star. <br><br>The truth will always be buried, erased, or forgotten if we don&#39;t come up with a way to record planetary history that can not be coopted, coerced, and corrupted for the use of individual agenda to enslave humanity.",
